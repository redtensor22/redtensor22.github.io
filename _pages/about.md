During my career path, one thing I've learned about myself is that I enjoy using analytic skills to tackle challenging problems. While in the military I learned the importance of discipline and hard work, and during my time in graduate school I learned the technical skills necessary to succeed in an environment requiring high levels of analytic knowledge. Perhaps one of the most eye-opening things I learned in graduate school, though, was how little I know. It seemed like with each new thing I learned, I found tenfold more things I didn't know. This expanse of potential knowledge is what drives me to continuously learn new things. I am now breaking into the field of data science, as I see a new and expansive field with much untapped potential and room to use my skills for the betterment of society. The picture shown above on this page was taken right before I summited Mt. Kilimanjaro; I think the same determination required to summit this peak is the same determination needed to push myself further and to learn more about the world around me.
